The pup that is responsible for it all!

# Service Deprecation

Effective **February 5, 2021**, the Tuckbot downloader has been **deprecated**. For an undetermined amount of time, the API and CDN will remain available for currently mirrored content. After that, all data pertaining to the project, including databases, video files, etc., will be purged.

Thank you for your interest in the project, whether you were a developer or a user. It was an interesting challenge and I am grateful for the people I've met and experience I've gained.

Tucker and I are going to focus our time, energy, and money into other projects. And more duck toys!
